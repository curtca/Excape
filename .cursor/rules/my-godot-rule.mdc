# .cursorrules for Godot Engine Game Development with GDScript

# General Guidelines
- Write clear, maintainable GDScript code with comments for complex logic.
- Organize scripts by scene or feature to maintain a clean project structure.
- Follow Godot's naming conventions: lowercase with underscores for scripts and variables.

# Functions and Methods
- Keep functions concise and focused on a single task.
- Use descriptive names for functions that reflect their purpose.
- Utilize signals for decoupled event handling and avoid tightly coupled logic.

# Data and State Management
- Favor Instanced Scenes for reusable game elements.
- Manage global state using Autoload scripts when needed.

# Performance Optimization
- Use built-in physics and navigation systems.
- Use Static Batching for static objects to improve rendering performance.

# Version Specific (Godot 4.3)
- Use Godot version 4.3
- Leverage new renderer features for improved visual quality.
- Take advantage of the latest GDScript improvements for better performance.

# Error Handling and Debugging
- Use print_debug() for verbose output during debugging.
- Implement error logging to capture unexpected behavior.

# Misc
- Don't warn about integer division
